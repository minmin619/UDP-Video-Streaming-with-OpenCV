# UDP Video Streaming with OpenCV - Resume Description


## Project Overview
Developed a **real-time video streaming system** using **UDP protocol** and **OpenCV**, enabling real-time webcam video transmission between a server and a client. The system supports:
- **Live video streaming over UDP**
- **X-ray filter effect applied in real-time**
- **Client-side screenshot functionality**

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, imutils, socket
- **Networking**: UDP socket programming
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV transformations

## Key Contributions
1. **Implemented real-time video streaming over UDP**
   - Captured video frames using OpenCV and transmitted them efficiently using UDP sockets.
   - Encoded frames as JPEG before transmission to optimize bandwidth usage.

2. **Designed an X-ray filter for real-time image processing**
   - Applied OpenCV's `cv2.bitwise_not()` function to invert image colors.
   - Resized and displayed processed frames on both server and client.

3. **Developed a screenshot functionality for filtered frames**
   - Allowed users to press `SPACE` to capture and save processed frames.
   - Automatically stored images in PNG format for later analysis.

4. **Optimized video transmission for low-latency streaming**
   - Reduced frame size and applied compression to ensure smooth video transmission over UDP.
   
## Achievements
**Reduced video transmission latency by optimizing frame encoding and resizing.**
**Successfully streamed and processed video in real-time with an interactive UI.**
**Enhanced user experience by adding screenshot functionality.**

## Potential Enhancements
- Support for **H.264 encoding** for better video compression.
- Integration with **WebRTC** for web-based video streaming.
- Implementation of **multi-client support** for broadcasting video.

## Resume Bullet Points
- Developed a **real-time video streaming system** using **Python, OpenCV, and UDP networking**.
- Optimized **image processing pipeline** to apply an X-ray filter in real-time with minimal latency.
- Designed and implemented a **screenshot feature** for capturing processed frames.
- Enhanced **video transmission efficiency** by utilizing **frame compression and resizing techniques**.
- Applied **network socket programming** to establish a client-server communication model for video streaming.
